We used JavaScript, Python, and the PostgreSQL database in the development of this project, aimed at addressing the challenge posed by NASA:

<b>Marketplace for Open Science Projects</b>

While there are numerous open science and open-source projects and tools, there is currently no efficient way to connect project creators with interested collaborators possessing the necessary skills to contribute. Our challenge is to create a solution that streamlines the search for open-source projects for those who wish to collaborate, as well as for project creators in need of qualified collaborators, providing an effective means for them to find and communicate with each other.

Some features are not fully functional at the moment, due to the instensity of the hackaton. But here's an Idea how our team would implement the software in its fully version:

  1. AI Recomendation algorithms that uses NPL (Neural Processing Language), understanding each user Biography and description, and sugesting science projects that may math each user profile, without limiting the users to some cold tags or categories. 
  2. Real time chat using web sockets and encrypted data.
  3. User friendly platform, that facilitates the process of getting informations about the projects, submitting to them and communicating with contributors worldwidely!
