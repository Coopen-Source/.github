We used JavaScript, Python, and the PostgreSQL database in the development of this project, aimed at addressing the challenge posed by NASA:

<b>Marketplace for Open Science Projects</b>

While there are numerous open science and open-source projects and tools, there is currently no efficient way to connect project creators with interested collaborators possessing the necessary skills to contribute. Our challenge is to create a solution that streamlines the search for open-source projects for those who wish to collaborate, as well as for project creators in need of qualified collaborators, providing an effective means for them to find and communicate with each other.
